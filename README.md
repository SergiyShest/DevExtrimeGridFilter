# DevExtrimeGridFilter
 Customaze Filter for DevExtrimeGrid
 My vision of a convenient filter for Devexreme DataGrid. 
 
 The standard filter Builder is universal, but it is not convenient, for example, to search for multiple objects by ID. 
 
 I deliberately use an isdn connection. Since this way you get easy-to-play examples.
